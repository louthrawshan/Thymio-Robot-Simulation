# Thymio-Robot-Simulation
Using Pygame library in python to build a simulator for the Thymio Robot, so that it can aid in Freshmore students learning python. This code has some bugs and not very sound overall. The updated code has been incorporated into a bigger library and can be found at https://github.com/kurniawano/pythymiodw/tree/master/pythymiodw.
